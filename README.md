## Overview
A simple layout design with a little challenge (for me) when changing the image hue on hover. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I practiced more the grid and flexbox. I learned how to overlap 2 elements and center them in CSS. I learned to use blend mode property. 


### Continued development
I am still struggling in designing responsive designs especially when starting with mobile first. There are many resources online but they don't always fit the actual needs and I struglle to understand how my choice of properties/values is influencing each other. 

### Useful resources

No specific resources were used. For values search of the CSS properties I used w3school and mdn web docs. I used web.dev as a guide for responsive design and semantic HTML.
